# Pet-Recognition
A group of Google Collab Notebooks that will allow you to have an example of how to train a Convolutional Neuronal Network.

Here you have 3 examples:
- A CNN trained from scratch.
- A CNN trained using VGG16 as a base model.
- A CNN trained using InceptionV3 as a base model.

Each one is trained using a LSTM layer and without it.
